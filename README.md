## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

RsyncUI and RsyncOSX are GUIÂ´s on the Apple macOS platform for the command line tool [rsync](https://github.com/WayneD/rsync). The main difference between the two apps is how the User Interface (UI) is built. It is `rsync` which executes the synchronize data tasks in both apps. The GUIÂ´s are only for organizing tasks, setting parameters to `rsync` and make it easier to use `rsync`. If you are on *macOS Sonoma* use RsyncUI. RsyncUI is under active development. 

### Install by Homebrew

Both apps might be installed by Homebrew or by direct Download. The apps are signed and notarized by Apple.

| App      | Homebrew | macOS |  Documentation |  
| ----------- | ----------- |   ----------- |  ----------- |
| RsyncUI   | `brew install --cask rsyncui`    | macOS Sonoma   |   [rsyncui.netlify.app](https://rsyncui.netlify.app/post/rsyncuidocs/) | 
| RsyncOSX   | `brew install --cask rsyncosx`  |  macOS Big Sur and later   |  [rsyncosx.netlify.app](https://rsyncosx.netlify.app/post/rsyncosxdocs/) |

### Why two apps and latest versions

The development of RsyncOSX commenced in *2015* as a private project to learn Swift. In *2019*, Apple released SwiftUI, which is a development framework for building user interfaces for iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, TVOS, and macOS. SwiftUI quickly became very popular and I commence another private project to learn SwiftUI. The model part of RsyncOSX was at that time quite stable, and I decided to refactor the GUI by SwiftUI. And that is the short story behind the two applications.

| App      | Storage  | #lines  | #files | UI | Latest version  |  Version 1.0.0 | 
| ----------- | ----------- |   ----------- | -------- |  -------- | -------- | -------- |
| RsyncUI   | JSON  | about 11.5k | 146  | SwiftUI, declarativ     | v1.9.0 - [12 April 2024](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncUI/releases)  | 6 May 2021  | 
| RsyncOSX  | JSON | about 11K | 121  | Storyboard, imperativ   | v6.8.0 - [13 April 2023](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSX/releases) |	14 March 2016 | 

### Important to verify new tasks

The UI of RsyncUI and RsyncOSX can for users who dont know `rsync` be difficult and complex to understand. Setting wrong parameters to `rsync` can result in deleted data.RsyncUI nor RsyncOSX will not stop you for doing so. That is why it is *very* important to execute a simulated run, a `--dry-run`, and verify the result before the real run.

### External task executing rsync 

Please be aware it is an external task *not controlled* by RsyncUI or RsyncOSX, which executes the command-line tool rsync. The progress and termination of the external rsync task are monitored. The user can abort the task at any time. Please let the abort finish and cleanup properly before starting a new task. It might take a few seconds. If not, the apps might become unresponsive.
